        When I finished school, I had a variety of choices to study at the university because I loved maths, physics, and programming. I finally ended up choosing Mechanical Engineering.

        I did my internship at Philip Morris International in Colombia in HR (I will not explain why, but this would be an exciting topic to have over coffee). I programmed some macros among all the duties. After doing so and realizing how much passion I put into building them, I realized that programming was my passion.

        Upon seeing an opportunity to study Full-Stack Web Development, I decided to pursue that dream. It has been a long ride in which I have built projects and learn programming languages and frameworks such as Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, and Redux. I gained tools like git, git-flow, refactoring the code, DRY rule, and loosely coupled objects and also acquired soft skills such as teamwork and how to receive and give feedback.
