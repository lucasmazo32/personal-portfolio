# About the project

The portfolio is a personal project to showcase my abilities in programming. I created this project using React and Redux, and the code is modularized to expand in the future.

It has a language feature in which you can choose between English or Spanish.

It has another feature in which you can interact with a terminal with some basic commands to display the information requested. You can change between interactive and standard views as much as you want. Type contact in the terminal so you can see cool stuff.
